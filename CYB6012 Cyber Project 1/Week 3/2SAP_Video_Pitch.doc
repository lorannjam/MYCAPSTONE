My prototype deliverable is almost at the industry readiness stage with my final hiccup being the that I cannot source a dongle to complete this project. My testing inside a virtual laboratory in CM Ware Workstation has been very productive and using generically built in Microsoft authentication methods, I believe my prototype is fully functional and industry ready.

My prototype testing in the virtual lab that I created in VM Workstation once configured using generic Microsoft login procedures with a password and / or a pin functioned perfectly as expected. 

Accessibility procedures included in testing with hearing or eyesight impaired users would also function perfectly after basic training with these users. 

I cant see any areas in this project that can be improved at this point in time. Testing so far has been without error or systemic problems and has progressed on schedule.

Possible final steps include the sourcing of a dongle to complete testing where I don’t see any inherent problems arising from these tests. Final testing will be completed once a dongle has been purchased and the final project signed of by stakeholders and delivery and implementation to the corporate client and other industry players can be implemented and delivered with minimal fuss. 

This project can also be used in existing corporate systems and would only take minimal time to install and deliver to the client.

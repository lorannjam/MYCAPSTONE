My project will incorporate a two step login password and a dongle generated pin to authenticate
users with an authentication server to login to workstations in your coporate environment.

The current  login system is outdated and needs to be upgraded with a new solution to fall
in line with current infrastructure and technology.

The dongle solution I plan to use will generate a pin when the button is pressed on the dongle
and used with a password that will syncronise with the server to allow login for the user.

This  solution will provide a more secure option and will add a second layer of protection
against unauthorised use or intrusion attacks against your system and bring your company up
to date with  current technology.

This project will be applied to your system and will run approximatly 6 months and  will be
an achievable cost to your company.

This solution is not highly technical and only requires a scripted change in the login
procedures on the server to accept the new password and dongle pin number integrated into
the login screen of each users computer.

Your current IT staff will be able to make the necessary changes and any scripting code will
be provided to your IT staff for implementation into your current system.

There will be no downtime of the servers or impact on your workers and the process will
integrate seamlessly into your current environment.

Training for all users should only take a few seconds and will not have any impact on the
costing of this project and should only require a simple email or memo to all users explaining
how to use the dongle and the new login procedures and will not add significantly to the costs
of the project.
